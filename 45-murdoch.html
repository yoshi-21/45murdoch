            <p>
                A new development plan for 45/49 Murdoch Street proposes a 31-unit apartment block that violates local
                planning regulations by exceeding the prescribed height limit by a massive 38%. This overreach directly
                impacts the surrounding neighborhood by overshadowing existing homes, intruding on resident and school privacy, and
                diminishing the overall aesthetic character of Cremorne.
                <br><br>
                Although development is a natural part of urban growth, such a large-scale project ignores carefully
                considered planning strategies that protect neighborhoods from congested living conditions and excessive
                building height. The proposed structure prioritises developer profit over environmental sustainability and
                the well-being of existing residents.<br><br>

        <!-- Extreme Height Violation -->
        <p>
            <b>Extreme Height Violation (38% Over the Legal Limit)</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The North Sydney Development Control Plan (NSDCP) limits building height to 12m.</li>
            <li>The developer is using the Affordable Housing SEPP loophole to request an increase to 15.6m, but is actually building to 16.6m—far beyond even that exemption.</li>
            <li>This sets a dangerous precedent for future overdevelopment—if allowed, more developers will use the same tactic to bypass planning controls.</li>
            <li>This is not a minor adjustment—it is a fundamental breach of zoning laws designed to protect residents.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Overshadowing & Loss of Sunlight -->
        <p>
            <b>Overshadowing & Loss of Sunlight</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The excessive height will block natural sunlight for many neighboring homes.</li>
            <li>Some residents may receive no direct sunlight at all.</li>
            <li>Morning, mid-morning, and late-afternoon sunlight will be affected.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Privacy Invasion -->
        <p>
            <b>Privacy Invasion</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The top floor exceeds regulations and lacks privacy screening.</li>
            <li>Residents in Education Lane, Murdoch Street, and Rangers Road will be overlooked by multiple units, exposing gardens, bedrooms, and living spaces. Higher-rise units south of Military Road (floors 3, 4, 5, and 6) will also have views impacted.</li>
            <li>Redlands Primary School is directly overlooked, creating a serious privacy issue for young children.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Unnecessary Environmental Impact -->
        <p>
            <b>Unnecessary Environmental Impact</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlike developments that increase density by replacing single-family homes, this project demolishes existing
                mid-density housing that already had an environmental impact.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Key environmental concerns:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Destroying existing housing stock—this is not an underutilised site; it already contains a 4-story building and townhouses.</li>
            <li>All existing tenants will be forced to leave and enter a more difficult rental market.</li>
            <li>Demolishing functioning homes generates construction waste and pollution without real community benefit.</li>
            <li>Increased population density strains local roads, parking, and public spaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Misleading "Affordable Housing" Claim -->
        <p>
            <b>Why the “Affordable Housing” Justification Is Misleading</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The developer claims the height-limit breach is justified by including affordable housing, but only 7 out of 31 units (22%) will be “affordable.”</li>
            <li>The developer retains ownership—this is not social housing.</li>
            <li>After 10 years, they can sell or rent these units at full market rates.</li>
            <li>The community gains no permanent affordability benefit, yet the excessive height remains forever.</li>
            <li>This is not true affordable housing—it’s a loophole to justify overdevelopment.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Final Note -->
        <p>
            <b>If this 38% height violation is approved:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developers will continue exploiting this loophole, further increasing density without community benefits.</li>
            <li>More overshadowing, loss of privacy, and infrastructure strain will follow.</li>
            <li>The NSDCP’s height limits exist for a reason—they protect our community from overdevelopment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>This is not responsible urban planning—it is profit-driven overdevelopment at the expense of the environment and community.</b>

<p>
To: The Planning Team, North Sydney Council<br>
Email: council@northsydney.nsw.gov.au<br><br>

Dear Council,<br><br>
I object to Development Application 010.2025.00000024.001 for 45 Murdoch Street due to violations of planning controls and harm to the community.<br><br>

<b>Height Violation & Overdevelopment</b><br><br>
Exceeds the 12m limit by 38%, reaching 16.6m. The Affordable Housing SEPP loophole does not justify a permanent breach, setting a dangerous precedent.<br><br>

<b>Overshadowing & Sunlight Loss</b><br><br>
Excessive height reduces morning, mid-morning, and late-afternoon light for nearby properties.<br><br>

<b>Privacy Concerns</b><br><br>
Overlooks private residences and Redlands Primary School, violating North Sydney’s principles and endangering student privacy.<br><br>

<b>Environmental Impact</b><br><br>
Demolishing mid-density housing for a taller project creates waste without real community benefit.<br><br>

<b>Misleading Affordable Housing</b><br><br>
Only 7 units at reduced rates for 10 years; this does not justify a permanent 38% height increase.<br><br>

I urge Council to reject or require compliance with the 12m limit and stronger privacy measures.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
[Your Name]<br>
[Your Address]<br>
[Your Email] (optional)<br>
